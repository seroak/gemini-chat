# Security Rules

- Store sensitive information in **environment variables** (DB password, JWT secret, Gemini API key, etc.).
- **Never commit** `.env` files (must be in `.gitignore`).
- Use **JWT-based authentication**.
- Hash passwords with **bcrypt** before storing.
- Configure **CORS** settings appropriately.
- Use **Helmet** for HTTP security headers.
- Apply **rate limiting** to prevent API abuse (especially AI API calls).
- Always perform **input validation** on user input.
- **Gemini API key** must only be used server-side; never expose to the client.
